            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p><span class="drop-cap">N</span>o amount of magic could cure the gloomy mood settling over eleven-year-old Billius Weasley one summer afternoon. The Burrow's kitchen was, as usual, in a state of chaos. Dirty breakfast plates floated unsteadily toward the sink, gently colliding before plunging back into the soapy water magically swirled by a common household charm. On the back of a chair, a half-finished jumper continued knitting itself, the needles clicking softly as they added more stitches to what appeared to be a maroon sleeve. Several grumpy garden gnomes huddled outside the window, still upset after being abruptly woken up by an irritable Ronin.</p>
                
                <figure class="illustration">
                    <img src="img/illus-01.png" alt="Burrow kitchen full of flying plates, lonely Billius at table" loading="lazy">
                </figure>
                
                <p>Breakfast plates zoomed towards the sink like badly aimed Quaffles, kicking off another morning at the Burrow, the wonderfully crooked house the Weasley family called home. Inside its cheerful kitchen, the usual magical chaos reigned: dirty dishes levitated towards soapy water stirred by an invisible hand, while a half-knitted jumper draped over a chair clicked its needles together, steadily adding rows to a lopsided maroon sleeve. Just outside the window, a cluster of recently evicted garden gnomes huddled by the muddy Wellington boots. Still cross from being whirled overhead and tossed over the hedge by thirteen-year-old Ronin Weasley earlier that morning, they shook their knobbly fists and grumbled tiny, earthy curses at the kitchen window.</p>
                
                <p>Billius slumped at the long wooden table, poking at a leftover piece of toast. His freckled face, usually bright with excitement, radiated with a sense of discomfort. Upstairs, he could hear the unmistakable thumps and bangs of his older brother, Ronin, attempting to pack his school trunk. Ronin was thirteen and, in just a few short weeks, would be heading off to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for the first time. Billius wasn't sure which felt worse: the thought of Ronin leaving, or the fizzing mixture of jealousy and impatience bubbling up inside him whenever he thought about Hogwarts.</p>
                
                <p class="sfx">"Honestly, Ronin, if you blast your socks through the floorboards one more time, you can patch it up yourself!" Mum's voice floated down the stairs. A moment later, a pair of sports socks zoomed past the kitchen doorway, chased by a faint puff of blue smoke.</p>
                
                <p>Billius sighed. Ronin got to learn <em>real</em> magic, proper spells, not just the accidental stuff that seemed to happen around Billius whenever he got particularly cross or excited – like the time Aunt Muriel's teacup had shattered when she'd called his hair "aggressively orange." Ronin would ride the Hogwarts Express, get Sorted into a House (Gryffindor, obviously, they were Weasleys!), and probably learn how to turn teacups into tortoises by lunchtime.</p>

                <p><span class="drop-cap">B</span>illius, meanwhile, was stuck here. Stuck with chores, stuck with waiting, stuck feeling... ordinary.</p>

                </figure>
                
                <p>A clatter from the pantry announced Dad's attempt to retrieve more Floo powder followed by a muffled exclamation that suggested he'd accidentally Apparated only halfway into the cramped space. Mum sprinted past Billius, wand out, muttering about needing stronger household charms.</p>
                
                <p>Left alone for a moment, Billius's gaze drifted to the most peculiar object in the kitchen: the Weasley family clock. It stood tall, dusty, and slightly crooked against a wall. Instead of numbers, it had little descriptions like 'Home,' 'School,' 'Traveling,' 'Lost,' 'Prison,' and even 'Mortal Peril.' Nine golden hands, each engraved with the name of a family member, pointed towards 'Home.' Well, all except one. Ronin's hand kept twitching excitedly between 'Home' and 'Traveling,' as if it couldn't quite wait to get going.</p>
                
                <p>Billius scowled at it. It wasn't <em>fair</em>. Why did Ronin get to <em>go now</em>? Why did Billius have to wait? He pushed his chair back, the legs scraping loudly on the stone floor. He approached the clock, feeling that familiar, restless itch under his skin. Dad had always warned them never to fiddle with the clock – its magic was old and temperamental, woven together with bits of string, hope, and who-knew-what-else over the years.</p>
                
                <p>But Ronin's hand seemed to mock him, vibrating with anticipation. Maybe... maybe if he just gave it a tiny nudge? Just to see what happened? His fingers hovered over the smooth, golden surface of Ronin's hand. He wasn't trying to break it, not really. He just wanted it to stop being so... <em>smug</em>.</p>
                
                <figure class="illustration">

                </figure>
                
                <p>With a sudden, impulsive movement, Billius tapped Ronin's hand firmly.</p>
                
                <p>There was no bang, no flash of light. For a second, nothing happened at all. Then, with a concerning <em>sproing</em> sound, like a spring uncoiling deep within the clock's works, Ronin's hand went haywire. It wobbled violently, spun around three times, and then detached itself completely from the clock face with a soft <em>plink</em>. It hovered in the air for a moment, gleaming, before magically vanishing into thin air.</p>

            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p><span class="drop-cap">B</span>illius stared, his mouth open. Ronin's hand was gone. Not pointing to 'Home' or 'Traveling' or anywhere else. Just... gone. The spot where it had been fixed was now an empty hole on the clock face.</p>
                
                <p>Panic flooded Billius. He hadn't meant for <em>that</em> to happen. He glanced wildly towards the pantry, where Dad was now presumably unstuck, and towards the stairs, where Mum was likely still lecturing Ronin about using magic for sock-packing.</p>
                
                <p>No one had seen.</p>
                
                <p>Billius's heart hammered in his chest. What if the clock was broken forever? What if Ronin's hand never came back? What if, somehow, this affected Ronin himself? Magical objects were unpredictable – everyone knew that. What if Ronin couldn't go to Hogwarts now because his stupid little brother had broken the family clock?</p>
                
                <figure class="illustration">
                    <img src="img/illus-04.png" alt="Billius looking panicked at the clock with the missing hand, while checking over his shoulder to see if anyone noticed" loading="lazy">
                </figure>
                
                <p>A sudden <em>thump</em> from upstairs made Billius jump. He could hear Ronin's footsteps thundering down the stairs. In a panic, Billius backed away from the clock, bumping into the kitchen table and nearly knocking over a jug of pumpkin juice.</p>
                
                <p>"Oi, Bill!" Ronin burst into the kitchen, his red hair even messier than usual. "Have you seen my Chudley Cannons poster? I can't find it anywhere, and I want to take it to—" He stopped abruptly, staring at Billius's face. "What's wrong with you? You look like you've seen a ghost. Well, a scary ghost, not like the ones at Hogwarts. They're mostly friendly, Dad says, except for the Bloody Baron, but he's only in Slytherin, and I won't be in—"</p>
                
                <p>"Nothing!" Billius said, too quickly. "Nothing's wrong. I haven't seen your poster."</p>
                
                <p>Ronin narrowed his eyes suspiciously. "You're acting weird." His gaze drifted past Billius to the family clock, and Billius felt his stomach drop. "Hang on..."</p>
                
                <p>Billius held his breath. This was it. Ronin would see his missing hand, and then there would be shouting, and Mum and Dad would find out, and Billius would probably be grounded until he was old enough for Hogwarts himself.</p>
                
                <p>But Ronin just frowned slightly at the clock, then shrugged. "Clock's acting up again. Dad said it might, with me going to school soon. Anyway, if you see my poster, let me know." And with that, he turned and thundered back up the stairs.</p>
                
                <p>Billius blinked in confusion. He spun around to look at the clock again – and gasped.</p>

                </figure>
                
                <p>Ronin's hand was back on the clock face. Not only that, but it was pointing firmly at 'Home,' just like everyone else's. But something was still wrong. All the hands – every single one of them – were wobbling slightly, as if caught in a gentle breeze that Billius couldn't feel.</p>

                <p><span class="drop-cap">F</span>or the next few days, Billius watched the clock anxiously. The wobbling hadn't stopped. Sometimes it was barely noticeable, just a slight tremor in the golden hands. Other times, especially when the house was particularly busy or noisy, the hands would spin and twitch alarmingly, though none had fallen off again.</p>
                
                <p>Billius hadn't told anyone what had happened. He'd thought about confessing to Dad, who would probably understand – Dad loved magical mishaps, after all – but every time he worked up the courage, something would interrupt: an owl with an urgent Ministry message, a small explosion from the shed where Dad kept his Muggle collection, or Mum calling everyone for dinner.</p>
                
                <figure class="illustration">
                    <img src="img/illus-06.png" alt="Billius watching the clock nervously while family chaos happens around him" loading="lazy">
                </figure>
                
                <p>The morning of Ronin's departure for Hogwarts arrived all too quickly. The Burrow was in an even greater state of chaos than usual. Trunks thumped down the stairs by themselves, only occasionally missing a step and spilling their contents. Owls swooped in and out with last-minute letters and forgotten items from relatives. Mum's wand was a blur as she simultaneously packed sandwiches, pressed robes, and lectured everyone about the importance of being on time.</p>
                
                <p>Billius sat at the kitchen table, watching it all unfold. He felt a strange mixture of emotions: envy that Ronin was going, sadness that his brother would be gone, and lingering anxiety about the clock, which was wobbling more violently than ever this morning.</p>
                
                <p>"All right there, Bill?" Dad asked, pausing beside him with a half-eaten piece of toast in one hand and what appeared to be a rubber duck in the other. "Not too down about Ronin leaving, are you? Your time will come before you know it."</p>
                
                <p>Billius shrugged. "I'm fine," he mumbled, though he wasn't, not really.</p>
                
                <p>Dad ruffled his hair affectionately. "Tell you what – after we see Ronin off, why don't you help me with a little project in the shed? I've got this fascinating Muggle device called a 'toaster' that I'm trying to understand."</p>
                
                <p>Despite himself, Billius felt a small smile tug at his lips. Dad's shed projects were always interesting, if somewhat hazardous.</p>
                
                <p>"Arthur! Billius! We're leaving in FIVE MINUTES!" Mum's voice rang through the house, magically amplified to reach every corner.</p>
                
                <figure class="illustration">
                    <img src="img/illus-07.png" alt="The chaotic scene of the family preparing to leave for the Hogwarts Express" loading="lazy">
                </figure>
                
                <p>As everyone scrambled to gather their things, Billius cast one last glance at the family clock. To his horror, all the hands had stopped wobbling and were now spinning rapidly, whirling around the clock face like the second hand of a normal timepiece.</p>
                
                <p>"Dad!" he cried out, pointing. "The clock!"</p>
                
                <p>Dad turned, his eyes widening behind his glasses. "Great Merlin's beard," he breathed, hurrying over to examine it. "I've never seen it do that before."</p>
                
                <p>The entire family gathered around, watching in astonishment as the hands spun faster and faster, becoming golden blurs.</p>
                
                <p>"What's happening to it?" Mum asked, her voice tight with concern.</p>
                
                <p>Dad shook his head, bewildered. "I'm not entirely sure. The magic in this clock is ancient, passed down through generations. It's tied to the family in ways even I don't fully understand."</p>
                
                <p>Billius felt sick with guilt. This was his fault. He should say something, confess what he'd done. He opened his mouth, the words on the tip of his tongue—</p>
                
                <p>And then, with a sound like a thousand tiny bells all chiming at once, the clock hands suddenly stopped spinning. One by one, they settled back into place, pointing at various locations: 'Home,' 'Traveling,' 'Work,' 'School.' Ronin's hand, which had been the first to stop, pointed firmly at 'School,' even though he hadn't left yet.</p>
                
                <figure class="illustration">
                    <img src="img/illus-08.png" alt="The family gathered around the clock as the hands settle into new positions" loading="lazy">
                </figure>
                
                <p>"Well, that's odd," Dad said, adjusting his glasses to peer more closely at the clock. "It seems to be... predicting? That's not what it usually does."</p>
                
                <p>"Is it broken?" Ronin asked, looking concerned. "Did I break it somehow?"</p>
                
                <p>"No, no," Dad assured him. "Magical objects sometimes develop new... er, quirks. Especially old ones like this. I'll have a proper look when we get back from King's Cross." He checked his watch. "Speaking of which, we really should be going now, or you'll miss the train!"</p>
                
                <p>As the family hurried out to the enchanted car in the driveway, Billius lingered for just a moment, staring at the clock. His own hand was pointing at 'Home,' but as he watched, it gave a small twitch and moved slightly towards 'Traveling.'</p>
                
                <p>And then, to his amazement, it winked at him. The tiny golden hand, with his name engraved upon it, actually winked, as if it had a miniature eye.</p>
                
                <p>"Billius Weasley! CAR! NOW!" Mum's voice jolted him back to reality.</p>
                
                <p>As Billius raced out to join his family, he couldn't help but smile. Maybe he hadn't broken the clock after all. Maybe he'd just... woken it up a bit. Made it more interesting. And maybe, just maybe, his time at the Burrow while waiting for his own Hogwarts letter wouldn't be so ordinary after all.</p>
